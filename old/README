To open calibration GUI
    pyFAI-calib2


Some Experimental setup information:
    Wavelength = 1.54185 A
    WAXS Calibrant: AgBh
    pixel size: 75x75 um

To calibrate:
    open gui in conda environment: pyFAI-calib2
    under Acquisition: open image file of AgBh
    under Detector, set Manual definition with pixel size 75x75um and detector size matching image
    under Experiment settings: Wavelength: 1.54185 A; Calibrant: AgBh
    Next >
    draw mask
    Next >
    Select Peaks
    Next >
    select SAXS constraints
    Fit
    Next >
    Save as PONI file...

    This will give you a base PONI file that we may need to adjust the beam center (poni1 and poni2)
    To fix this, exit the GUI and reopen it, and load in instead the file that we will study
    Set everything the same.
    We will likely have to set the peaks manually by eye and only fit one peak;
    the goal is to just "flatten" out the cake & integration plot so that the origin can be found.
    Save this PONI as well and then copy the Poni values into the other file to get the beam center right.
